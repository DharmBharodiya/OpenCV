# sobel -> finds eges in specific directions, first derivative
# computes gradients in two direction, x and y
#Sobel uses first-order derivatives to calculate the rate of change in pixel intensity. It highlights regions where intensity changes sharply â€” that is, edges.

# It does this separately in the horizontal (X) and vertical (Y) directions.
